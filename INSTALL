How to build and install tag
----------------------------

The only real prerequisite for building tag is a decent C99 compiler.

On Windows, the following command on Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017

> cl tag.c

generates an executable named tag.exe, which has no special dependency
so you can relocate it into your favorite folder in PATH.

On Unix-like system, running GNU Make with GCC or Clang results in an executable
named tag:

$ make

All you have to do for installation is to move the executable to a directory in
your PATH.
